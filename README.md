What Is An AI-Based eLearning Platform?
An AI-based eLearning platform is a machine/system that possesses the ability to perform different tasks requiring human intelligence. It maintains the ability to create solutions to human-related problems, like speech recognition, translations involving different languages, decision making, and much more.

Even in our mobile devices, an Artificial Intelligence engine is incorporated to help with studying our patterns in order to create likely suggestions during texting. Even though the AI-based eLearning platform hasn't become a standard learning approach amidst most learning organizations, there's a need for it.

Although Artificial Intelligence is not of much use, it's on the way to making a positive contribution toward the effectiveness of eLearning training. Below are some of the ways that AI can be introduced in order to impact and improve your eLearning.

Well, an AI-based eLearning platform has the potential to influence the future of eLearning and positively impact its development in diverse ways.

5 Ways An AI-Based eLearning Platform Can Shape Online Learning
1. Real-Time Questioning
One of the vital roles of an AI-based eLearning platform is its ability to act as a tutor and provide answers to real-time questions. Many learners face difficulties when trying to get clarification on a specific topic while learning is going on. While some learners are bold enough to seek clarification during the learning program, some are not.

However, by incorporating Artificial Intelligence into your learning program, you are able to provide the best option for learners to seek clarification anytime and at their convenience. With AI, learners can easily ask questions on subject matter that is unclear and get immediate answers.

2. Generate Fresh Learning Content
For SMEs and eLearning professionals, creating course content is one of the factors of eLearning that consumes a lot of time. AI systems, if well trained, can help to draw out valuable information and convert it into smart content for digital learning. This allows professionals to focus more on creating an engaging digital learning experience for their learners.

eLearning course creation is one of the challenging parts of digital learning as it requires several skills. With AI's continuous growth, it can help to combine all the necessary skills to deliver an effective eLearning course.

3. Natural Language Processing
How many times have your learners wanted to communicate with your learning course in their language? Well, with an Artificial Intelligence system, this is a dream come true for you. The most essential part (or sub-field) of Artificial Intelligence is natural language processing. It's focused on enabling systems to quickly and efficiently process human language.

So, by integrating AI into your eLearning program learners are able to interact and ask questions from the system in the style/language of their choice. This, as well as making learning more accessible, will save time and help with developing engaging and efficient eLearning.

4. Personalized Tutoring Session
eLearning has been a great advantage for instructors in the sense that it enables them to create content that gets shared to different learners. Ideally, it's almost impossible for an instructor to cater to the needs of every learner at the same time.

Of course, this one-size-fits-all approach is common in corporate training. It's not the best approach as individuals have different learning styles that should be taken into consideration before delivering content.

Artificial Intelligence is vital for checking a learner's past performance and understanding their learning style. AI uses the data to make changes to the new learning material before delivering a personalized learning experience, which learners crave.

5. Gamification
Gamification is an essential approach used in eLearning to engage and motivate learners toward acquiring new knowledge. With AI, planning tactical games for online training material is easy. It helps to process large amounts of data, which is then used to determine learners' behavior and to provide them with updates about their learning progress.

In Conclusion
The impact of Artificial Intelligence on eLearning has advanced in today's time. Through these 5 ways, we can shape online learning and make it more engaging and effective. AI will also change the way training in the workplace is delivered.
